(** This modules defines what is the view over a concrete identifiers.

    Hax manipulates concrete identifiers (that is global identifiers referring to
    concrete Rust items -- not built-in operators) as raw Rust identifiers
    augmented with some metadata.

    Rust represents identifiers as a crate and a path. Each chunk of the path is
    roughly a level of nest in Rust. The path lacks information about
    definition kinds.

    There is two kinds of nesting for items.
    - Comfort: e.g. the user decides to embed a struct within a function to work
      with it locally.
    - Relational: e.g. an associated method has to be under a trait, or a field
      has to be under a constructor.

    This module provides a view to those paths: a path in the view is a list of
    smaller relational paths. For instance, consider the following piece of
    code:

    {@rust[
      mod a {
          impl MyTrait for MyType {
              fn assoc_fn() {
                  struct LocalStruct {
                      field: u8,
                  };
              }
          }
      }
    ]}

    Here, the Rust raw definition identifier of [LocalStruct] is roughly
    [my_crate::a::<Impl 0>::assoc_fn::LocalStruct::field].

    The view for [LocalStruct] looks like:
    [{
      {
        path: ["mycrate"; "a"],
        name_path: [
          `AssociatedItem ("assoc_fn", `Impl 0);
          `Field ("field", `Constructor ("LocalStruct", `Struct "LocalStruct"))
        ]
      }
    }]

    The types defined by this module are indexed by two other types: ['name] and
    ['disambiguator]. This helps for instrumenting the view to perform
    additional operations: see [collect_either], [collect] and [root].
