In June, we successfully merged **21 pull requests**!

[@Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril) and [@N1ark](https://github.com/N1ark) continued the improvements on the frontend side with the addition of unchecked arithmetic operators ([#1513](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1513)), regrouping generic and trait arguments in a struct ([#1514](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1514)), support of trait aliases in `full_def` ([#1494](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1494)), addition of `Ty::FnDef` ([#1487](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1487)), drop calls resolution ([#1467](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1467)) and more.

[@W95Psp](https://github.com/W95Psp), [@clementblaudeau](https://github.com/clementblaudeau) and myself worked on adding infrastructure for writing backends and compilation phases for hax in Rust (instead of Ocaml). We now have a Rust version of the hax AST and we can convert back and forth from the Ocaml version (which should allow to incrementally replace Ocaml phases by Rust phases). We also offer utilities for printing this AST when implementing backends. Our plan for the next months is to use this for the new backends we will add, and experiment with Rust phases.

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
