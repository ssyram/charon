In July, we successfully merged **32 pull requests**!

[@Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril) made sure that we use a recent version of rustc (PR [\#1534](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1534)) and made new improvements to trait resolution in the frontend (PR [\#1522](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1522)).

We continued efforts to improve the usability of hax with several f* core lib additions, and improvements to the CI.

More importantly, [@W95Psp](https://github.com/W95Psp), [@clementblaudeau](https://github.com/clementblaudeau) and myself worked on improvements of the new hax engine implemented in Rust (PR [\#1508](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1508), [\#1518](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1518), [\#1525](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1525) and [\#1526](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1526)).

Finally, let's celebrate the arrival of our new backend for lean (PR [\#1509](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1509))! [@clementblaudeau](https://github.com/clementblaudeau) is taking the lead on this project. This backend is implemented in Rust using our new infrastructure. It is still under active development and many improvements will come in the next couple of months. 

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
