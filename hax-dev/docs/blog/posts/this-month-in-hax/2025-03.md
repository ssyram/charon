In March, we successfully merged **32 pull requests**!

Thanks [@Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril), who helped move `hax` forward by pinning it to a more recent nightly version of the Rust compiler ([#1380](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1380)). Nadrieril also continued work on the frontend. Trait resolution is now more robust, especially in the presence of closures ([#1376](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1376)), and our handling of constants has seen significant improvements, with refinements introduced in both [#1367](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1367) and [#1337](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1337).

Outside of the frontend, we also focused on enhancements and fixes within `hax-lib` and the engine. Notably, support for mathematical integers and logical propositions has been strengthened, making reasoning more precise and expressive ([#1372](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1372), [#1352](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1352), [#1351](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1351)). Additionally, we resolved several issues related to the use of `self` in contracts, improving overall stability and correctness in those scenarios.

March also brought new capabilities to `hax-lib`. The newly introduced `decreases` attribute makes it possible to express termination arguments directly in Rust, giving users better control over termination checking. Furthermore, the addition of the `<backend>::replace_body` family of attributes allows developers to substitute the body of a Rust function with backend-specific code, offering a powerful mechanism for fine-tuned extraction when needed.

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
