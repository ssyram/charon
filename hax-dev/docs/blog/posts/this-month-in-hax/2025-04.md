In April, we successfully merged **38 pull requests**!

Thanks [@Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril), for pinning a more recent nightly version of the Rust compiler ([#1391](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1391)). Nadrieril also continued making the frontend more robust and complete with work on constants [#1402](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1402, [#1420](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1420), [#1429](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1429)) and item's children ([#1412](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1412)).

[@W95Psp](https://github.com/W95Psp) worked on `hax-lib` with improved support for writing f* lemmas in rust ([#1428](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1428)), and fstar post-processing with tactics ([#1437](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1437)).

I worked on while loops which now support invariants and variants (to prove termination) in [#1375](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1375)

We also worked on various improvements like removing deprecated dependencies used by hax-lib ([#1385](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1385) and [#1394](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1394)), some ProVerif backend workarounds by [@jschneider-bensch](https://github.com/jschneider-bensch) ([#1360](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1360), [#1401](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1401) and [#1406](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1406)), and multiple f* core lib additions.

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
