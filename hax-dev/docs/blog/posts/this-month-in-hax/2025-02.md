title: "This Month in Hax: February 2025"
date: 2025-03-05

In February, we merged **23 pull requests**!

The MIR translation of the frontend was improved by
[@Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril): some bugs were fixed, and our
handling of constants have been improved and is now more robust. 

One of the major updates this month was the introduction of a new
[`Prop` abstraction](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1301) in `hax-lib`,
which enhances expressiveness in property-based reasoning within the Hax
engine. With `Prop`, it is now possible to write non-computable properties that leverage universal quantifiers.

We also made significant progress in the engine, including fixing issues
related to [`continue` handling in loops](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1296) 
and ensuring proper naming and disambiguation in bundled components 
([#1280](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1280), [#1286](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1286)).

We also tackled improvements in the F\* backend, such as fixing trait
inheritance in `rand-core` ([#1322](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1322)) and 
expanding the core library ([#1292](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1292)).

Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months!
