title: "This Month in Hax: August 2025"

In August, we successfully merged **17 pull requests**!

This month, we continued the effort of building out the new hax engine in Rust, with a focus on creating a robust infrastructure for backend development. We introduced a generic [`Backend` trait](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1603) and a new [printing infrastructure](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1600), which will simplify the process of creating new backends. We also improved how [global identifiers](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1624) are handled and added [visitors](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1585).

Building on this new infrastructure, the Lean backend saw significant progress. This month, we merged [the first Lean proofs](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1590) and a set of [Lean examples](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1593). The Lean printer was also [updated](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1607) to leverage the latest improvements in the Rust engine.

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
