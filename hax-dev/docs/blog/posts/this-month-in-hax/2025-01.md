This blog post continues our ongoing series introduced in the [previous blog of
hax](https://hacspec.org/blog/tags/this-month-in-hax/), a monthly collection of
highlights showcasing key developments in hax and its ecosystem.

This month, we merged **31 pull requests** and celebrated a major milestone by
releasing the first official version of hax:
[v0.1.0](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/releases/tag/cargo-hax-v0.1.0). If you
havenâ€™t already, be sure to check out [our blog post](../announce-v0.1.md) for
more details on this release!

We tackled a variety of bug fixes and engine improvements. One significant
achievement was resolving a long-standing issue related to the inconsistent
preservation of declaration orders between Rust and the extractions. This
problem [was finally fixed](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1247). ðŸŽ‰

Additionally, we merged [a comprehensive
overhaul](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1199) of how identifiers are
treated and represented within the engine. This rework allowed us to fix nearly
ten related issues, making the system more robust and efficient.

In the F\* backend, we transitioned away from using
[HACL\*](https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star) machine integers. Instead, we
now rely on a [thin wrapper](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1238) over
F\*'s native mathematical integers. Unlike HACL\*'s opaque machine integers,
this new representation allows us to use F\*'s normalizer freely, offering a
cleaner and more lightweight solution.

Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months!
